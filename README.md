This is my sumbmission for Case Study 1.   The folder structure should be as expected, with the RMD and MD files (Named Case_Study_1_Main_Output) in the project directory, R code for the analysis (named Analysis_Script) in the Analysis Directory, and the data files together with related R_Code used to get comfortable with the data sets and Merge them (Data_Manipulation_Script) in the Data Directory.

There is file in the Data Directory called Dupe_Breweries.  This is code I used to look at whether or not there were bad entries in the Breweries file.  There were a few, but I did not change the data.  I refer to this process in the write up and the code is available if someone wants to see it.  I did not include it in the Markdown file because I felt it would provide more distraction than it was worth.
